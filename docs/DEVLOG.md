## Session 0: the scaffold

3 October 2026 · branch `claude/s0-scaffold`

This session ran on the owner's Mac rather than in a cloud session: macOS 27, Docker Desktop 4.93, `swift:6.4-noble` on arm64. No tool available here opens a cloud session with both repositories selected. CI runs the same build on GitHub's amd64 runner. The shared plan (rev 43) and specification matched their files when the session started.

**Delivered**

- `upstream/FRUS-Explorer`, pinned to `34a5120` (tag `build-49`, index version 65). That commit matches the owner's Mac build and research export.
- `scripts/swift`, which runs SwiftPM in `swift:6.4-noble` plus `libsqlite3-dev`, in a derived image it builds once. `scripts/doctor` checks Docker, the image, the submodule and the container's network.
- `Package.swift`:
  - `CSQLite`;
  - SourceNoteKit, CrossRefKit and GeneratorKit and their tests, from the submodule with upstream's settings;
  - `FTS5Schema`, which is `FTS5Types.swift` alone;
  - the FTS5 check;
  - `FRUSLightServer`, which prints its version.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: build, test (failing on any skipped test) and counts per target.
- `fixtures/tei/`: the three volumes from HistoryAtState/frus `8e5da08`, with `SOURCE` and `SHA256SUMS`. They are byte-identical to the Mac app's copies and to GitHub's.
- `CLAUDE.md`, this log and `.gitignore`.

**Results**

| Target | Tests | Linux, arm64 | macOS, native |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SourceNoteKitTests | 292 | Pass | Pass |
| CrossRefKitTests | 10 | Pass | Pass |
| GeneratorKitTests | 7 | Pass | Pass |
| FTS5CheckTests | 3 | Pass | Pass |

Both builds have no warnings. The FTS5 check builds `frus_documents` with `FTS5Schema.frusDocuments.createTableSQL` over a `document_cache` content table.
- **Prefix stemming:** FTS5's porter tokenizer stems a prefix term as if it were a whole word. So `negoti*` and `negotiating*` match "negotiating", while `negotiat*` stays `negotiat*` and matches nothing; no stored term begins with it.
- **NEAR distance:** a second document holds both words beyond the NEAR distance, so the distance itself is tested.
- **Malformed queries:** a malformed query must throw rather than return no rows.

**Notes for later sessions**

- `scripts/swift` passes proxy variables and a CA bundle only when they are set, and none were set here. S1, the first cloud session, should run `scripts/doctor` first and record whether the container reaches github.com.
- Both scripts add `~/.docker/bin` to `PATH` when `docker` is missing, as on a Mac where Docker Desktop's CLI is not on a non-interactive shell's path.
- In a git worktree, `/src/.git` points outside the container's mount, so git inside the container fails at the repository root. SwiftPM builds don't need it; `scripts/doctor` runs its network check from `/tmp`.
- Rule 3 asks for the session's task to be ticked in `docs/PLAN.md`, but the plan has no per-session checkbox, so nothing was ticked. Changing the plan would also put it out of step with its shared copy. `docs/prep/README.md` now lists this under "Before the S1 prompt".
- After this CI has run, the owner protects `main`: pull requests required, no required approvals, and the `swift` check required.

**Next: S1.** An upstream pull request with Linux guards for TEIHeaderKit, SemanticVectorsKit and FTS5Store. Before writing its prompt, settle the items under "Before the S1 prompt" in `docs/prep/README.md`, and answer the plan's open question on pull requests to `FRUS-Explorer`. `docs/prep/s1-linux-guards.patch` is a starting point.
