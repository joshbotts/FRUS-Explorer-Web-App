## Session 2: the server and Import mode

3 October 2026 · branch `claude/s2-server-import`

S1 waits. The owner asked that sessions not open pull requests on `FRUS-Explorer` for now, so the server track went first. Like S0, this session ran on the owner's Mac.

**Delivered**

- **The server.** `FRUSLightServer` is a Hummingbird 2.27 server with three endpoints:
  - `/healthz` answers as soon as the process runs.
  - `/readyz` returns 503 naming the current step, and 200 once an index is open.
  - `/api/v1/status` reports the versions, SQLite's version, the index summary, and an import's progress and outcome.

  `--version` still prints the version.
- **Configuration.** The phase-1 variables in SPEC's table are read: `FRUS_MODE`, `FRUS_AUTH`, `FRUS_DATA_DIR`, `FRUS_PUBLIC_URL`, `FRUS_PDF_URL` and `FRUS_OFFLINE`. Every problem is reported at once. Standalone mode and sign-in are refused until their phases. Beyond SPEC's table:
  - `FRUS_HOST` defaults to 127.0.0.1, as SPEC's Security section asks; the image in S5 sets 0.0.0.0.
  - `FRUS_PORT` defaults to 8080.
  - `FRUS_IMPORT_POLL_SECONDS` defaults to 2, from 0.05 to 3600.
  - `LOG_LEVEL` sets the log level.
- **Import mode.** A watcher looks at `/data/import`. It imports a file once the file has stopped changing between two looks and has reached the size its SQLite header records; `docker compose cp` makes a file visible while it is still copying. The steps:
  1. `copying_export`: the backup API copies the export into `frus.db.new`.
  2. `checking_format`: the tables are present, `user_version` is 4, and the copy is switched to rollback-journal mode.
  3. `checking_versions`: a stamped export must have both index versions at 65 and both FTS schema versions at 4. An unstamped copy must have every `document_revisions.index_version` at 65.
  4. `checking_writing`: an export with notes, summaries or tags is refused, since phase 1 serves the corpus only. So is a stamp that denies writing the file holds.
  5. `checking_integrity`: `quick_check`, then the rank-1 check on both FTS tables, run on the writable copy.
  6. `installing_index`: through `IndexWriter`, `frus.db` becomes `frus.db.prev` and `frus.db.new` becomes `frus.db`.
  7. `opening_index`: the index opens with `immutable=1`.

  Failures are sorted by fault:
  - **The file's fault** (a refusal): it stays where it is and is not tried again until it changes.
  - **The server's fault** (too little disk space, a write error): it is tried again after a minute.

  An installed file is removed from the drop zone. If it cannot be removed, the import report says so, and it is not imported again. An export that is already live, found again after a restart that came between installing it and removing it, is removed rather than re-imported over the rollback copy. A copy that arrives with a non-empty `-wal` beside it is refused: `immutable=1` would ignore the newest data in it.

  The install keeps the old index as `frus.db.prev` through a hard link, then replaces `frus.db` with one atomic `rename`, so `frus.db` exists at every instant.

  Blocking SQLite work runs on Dispatch threads, off Swift's cooperative pool. At start, the server listens before it opens the existing index, so `/healthz` answers at once; meanwhile `/readyz` reports `opening_index`. An index at another version leaves the server not ready, with both versions named. A file still arriving is named in `/readyz`.
- **The five v1 interfaces**, each with its phase 1 implementation:
  1. `IndexWriter`: `LocalIndexWriter`, plus `ReadOnlyIndexWriter` for snapshot mode.
  2. `CorrectionStore`: override rows in `app.db`.
  3. `UserStore`: `SQLiteUserStore`, with numbered migrations. Migration 1 adds `users` and `index_corrections`.
  4. `SessionStore` (in memory), `JobQueue` (in process; imports run as jobs) and `FileStore` (`DataDirectory`).
  5. `/healthz` and `/readyz`.
- **Tests.** Synthetic exports are built from the real v65 export's schema, kept as `Tests/FRUSLightTestSupport/Fixtures/export-v65-schema.sql` (schema only, no rows). The tests cover:
  - every refusal reason;
  - disk space as a server-side problem that is tried again;
  - an undeletable drop file, and an export that is already live;
  - the walk through every import step, checked at `/readyz` through the router;
  - a restart, and the watcher's import, through the application `buildApplication` makes;
  - a clean stop on shutdown;
  - that the supported index version, the FTS schema version and the export's FTS DDL match the pinned submodule.

  One path is covered only by sorting a SQLite failure by its result code: a destination write failing during the copy.

**Results**

| Target | Tests | Linux, arm64 | macOS, native |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SourceNoteKitTests | 292 | Pass | Pass |
| CrossRefKitTests | 10 | Pass | Pass |
| GeneratorKitTests | 7 | Pass | Pass |
| FTS5CheckTests | 3 | Pass | Pass |
| FRUSLightCoreTests | 36 | Pass | Pass |
| FRUSLightServerTests | 8 | Pass | Pass |

**The owner's real export.** The 2.83 GB file, exported on 3 October from build 49, was imported on Linux in a container, with `/data` in a named volume and the file copied in with `docker cp`:
- the server waited for the copy to finish;
- it imported in about 18 seconds: 3 to copy, 15 to check;
- it then served 316,768 documents from 553 volumes, at index version 65.

A restart was ready in 2 seconds with no copy. The import was then repeated with the container on one CPU:
- across 164 `/healthz` requests made during the 15-second integrity check, the slowest took 17 ms;
- SIGTERM stopped the server with exit status 0 in 0.15 seconds.

**Deferred, with the reason**

- Comparing each document's `content_hash` and `body_hash` with its TEI (SPEC's import step 5), and a `content_hash` self-check. Both need `IndexingPipeline` (S6); hashing here would reimplement it (rule 4).
- Moving an export's writing into the user store waits for phase 2, as do the backups that precede each `app.db` migration.
- SPEC rule 7 has the server write corrections into the index, but phase 1 serves it immutable. Corrections are stored as override rows first, and how they reach a served index is decided before phase 3.

**Next: S5.** The image and a Compose smoke test, on the server track. S4, the parity harness, needs no upstream changes and can run too. S1, S3 and S6 wait for upstream pull requests.

## Session 0: the scaffold

3 October 2026 · branch `claude/s0-scaffold`

This session ran on the owner's Mac rather than in a cloud session: macOS 27, Docker Desktop 4.93, `swift:6.4-noble` on arm64. No tool available here opens a cloud session with both repositories selected. CI runs the same build on GitHub's amd64 runner. The shared plan (rev 43) and specification matched their files when the session started.

**Delivered**

- `upstream/FRUS-Explorer`, pinned to `34a5120` (tag `build-49`, index version 65). That commit matches the owner's Mac build and research export.
- `scripts/swift`, which runs SwiftPM in `swift:6.4-noble` plus `libsqlite3-dev`, in a derived image it builds once. `scripts/doctor` checks Docker, the image, the submodule and the container's network.
- `Package.swift`:
  - `CSQLite`;
  - SourceNoteKit, CrossRefKit and GeneratorKit and their tests, from the submodule with upstream's settings;
  - `FTS5Schema`, which is `FTS5Types.swift` alone;
  - the FTS5 check;
  - `FRUSLightServer`, which prints its version.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: build, test (failing on any skipped test) and counts per target.
- `fixtures/tei/`: the three volumes from HistoryAtState/frus `8e5da08`, with `SOURCE` and `SHA256SUMS`. They are byte-identical to the Mac app's copies and to GitHub's.
- `CLAUDE.md`, this log and `.gitignore`.

**Results**

| Target | Tests | Linux, arm64 | macOS, native |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SourceNoteKitTests | 292 | Pass | Pass |
| CrossRefKitTests | 10 | Pass | Pass |
| GeneratorKitTests | 7 | Pass | Pass |
| FTS5CheckTests | 3 | Pass | Pass |

Both builds have no warnings. CI on GitHub's amd64 runner passed with the same counts (run 37146459177); the build took 26 seconds. The FTS5 check builds `frus_documents` with `FTS5Schema.frusDocuments.createTableSQL` over a `document_cache` content table.
- **Prefix stemming:** FTS5's porter tokenizer stems a prefix term as if it were a whole word. So `negoti*` and `negotiating*` match "negotiating", while `negotiat*` stays `negotiat*` and matches nothing; no stored term begins with it.
- **NEAR distance:** a second document holds both words beyond the NEAR distance, so the distance itself is tested.
- **Malformed queries:** a malformed query must throw rather than return no rows.

**Notes for later sessions**

- `scripts/swift` passes proxy variables and a CA bundle only when they are set, and none were set here. S1, the first cloud session, should run `scripts/doctor` first and record whether the container reaches github.com.
- Both scripts add `~/.docker/bin` to `PATH` when `docker` is missing, as on a Mac where Docker Desktop's CLI is not on a non-interactive shell's path.
- In a git worktree, `/src/.git` points outside the container's mount, so git inside the container fails at the repository root. SwiftPM builds don't need it; `scripts/doctor` runs its network check from `/tmp`.
- Rule 3 asks for the session's task to be ticked in `docs/PLAN.md`, but the plan has no per-session checkbox, so nothing was ticked. Changing the plan would also put it out of step with its shared copy. `docs/prep/README.md` now lists this under "Before the S1 prompt".
- After this CI has run, the owner protects `main`: pull requests required, no required approvals, and the `swift` check required.

**Next: S1.** An upstream pull request with Linux guards for TEIHeaderKit, SemanticVectorsKit and FTS5Store. Before writing its prompt, settle the items under "Before the S1 prompt" in `docs/prep/README.md`, and answer the plan's open question on pull requests to `FRUS-Explorer`. `docs/prep/s1-linux-guards.patch` is a starting point.
